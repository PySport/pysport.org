Back in 2020 we had some great news: Bruno Dagnino joins as a maintainer for the kloppy project.

And now, in 2022 we have our first alumni maintainer.

## A look back

In April 2020, Koen contacted Bruno with a question about Metrica's open data. A few messages and video call later, we came to the conclusion that Bruno could perfectly fill the role of co-maintainer. We soon had a biweekly meeting where all developments of the Kloppy project were discussed.  

### Focus on the users
The focus was on how we could make it easier to use the library and how we could show more people what you can do with Kloppy. Bruno promoted kloppy wherevery he could :-)

### Code contributions
Bruno has also made a huge contribution to the technology under the hood: good models for metadata, EPTS reader, standard normalization of coordinates and many bug fixes, among others.

### Final words
Now, about 2 years later, I would like to thank Bruno for his great contribution to kloppy, promoting open source and for the many super fun and instructive meetings. Good luck and have fun with your new adventure!
