When we started in April we didn't have our vision very clear yet. We love the sports analytics community and had the feeling we could contribute to it. Sharing knowledge from other domains into the sports analytics domain. 

With the launch of [kloppy](https://github.com/pySport/kloppy) we thought we helped the community to provide a library to get over the first barrier of sports analytics: reading and parsing data. Well.. that didn't go as expected. We had some very useful user feedback: "We start with copy and pasting examples, and see if it runs. When it does we'll try to adjust it to our needs and we're done." Our conclusion: no-one needs a well designed library with automated tests. Unless you have to maintain the library.

That might be the case more domains. Not sure. But once again an article comes to mind. Back in 2017 SportTechie published the article [Sports Technology has a problem: end user programming](https://www.sporttechie.com/sports-technology-problem-end-user-programming/). 
[Ravi Ramineni](https://twitter.com/analyseFooty) shares his experience when he joined Sounders: "Everything was on a couple of spreadsheets." In the same article Dr. Dorn says the following: 
> “Most of the code is throw away code,” adds Dorn, meaning that it’s never going to be incorporated into a larger code base, or likely to be seen by anyone besides the person who wrote it. [....] When programming is treated as problem-solving, like it often is in sports, the solutions are frequently suboptimal. Quality tools for end user programming are a significant help in achieving better user outcomes.

"Most of the code is throw away code" Our software developers heart hurts.


> **PySport** supports a community where **everyone** can become better in **sports analytics**. Everyone in the community shares the common passion: sports analytics. **Sharing knowledge** and **teaching/learning** are core-values of the community. PySport brings experts and learners together and encourages the creation and maintenance of **high-quality open-source** projects, that can be used for development and learning.




At first I was a bit into doubt if I should open source kloppy. There is already a lot educational stuff out there in the sports analytics community. Why would people need another library.
When I look back it was a really good decision. I'll share my experience, what I learned and what I hope to learn into the (near) future.

kloppy is my first open source project.

Since the launch of kloppy we had some very interesting chats with clubs, companies and other community members. 

All the effort put into kloppy is worth every minute of it.
