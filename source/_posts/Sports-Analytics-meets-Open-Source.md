> **PySport** supports a community where **everyone** can become better in **sports analytics**. Everyone in the community shares the common passion: sports analytics. **Sharing knowledge** and **teaching/learning** are core-values of the community. PySport brings experts and learners together and encourages the creation and maintenance of **high-quality open-source** projects, that can be used for by end-users development and learning.


When we started in April we didn't have our vision very clear yet. We love the sports analytics community and had the feeling we could contribute to it. Sharing knowledge from other domains into the sports analytics domain. 

With the launch of [kloppy](https://github.com/pySport/kloppy) we thought we helped the community to provide a library to get over the first barrier of sports analytics: reading and parsing data. Well.. that didn't go as expected. We had some very useful user feedback: "Those layers causes too much cognitive load. [...] We start with copy and pasting examples, and see if it runs. When it does we'll try to adjust it to our needs and we're done." Our conclusion: no-one needs a well designed library with automated tests. Unless you have to maintain the library.

That might be the case more domains. Not sure. But once again an article comes to mind. Back in 2017 SportTechie published the article [Sports Technology has a problem: end user programming](https://www.sporttechie.com/sports-technology-problem-end-user-programming/). 
[Ravi Ramineni](https://twitter.com/analyseFooty) shares his experience when he joined Sounders: "Everything was on a couple of spreadsheets." In the same article we can read the following: 
> ‚ÄúMost of the code is throw away code,‚Äù adds Dorn, meaning that it‚Äôs never going to be incorporated into a larger code base, or likely to be seen by anyone besides the person who wrote it. [....] When programming is treated as problem-solving, like it often is in sports, the solutions are frequently suboptimal. Quality tools for end user programming are a significant help in achieving better user outcomes.

"Most of the code is throw away code" Our software developers heart hurts. 

But it is how it is. We need to deal with it.

How should we adapt? [Vincent Warmerdam](https://twitter.com/fishnets88) wrote an excellent article about [Roman Reasoning](https://koaning.io/posts/roman-reasoning), and this is the direction we should head into.
> So maybe ‚Ä¶ as a rule of thumb; when a diagram explains the steps of your system way better than your code, think about how you can get the code to look more like the diagram.


### Cross sport
Our vision doesn't say anything about a type of sports. That's by intention. We believe we should keep on looking for opportunities to apply a solution from sport A to sport B. When we start being creative and think about how to apply solutions from one sport to another the innovation while be a magnitude faster. There are probably more examples, but [adam](https://twitter.com/sonty_1) did this by applying "Wide Open Spaces" (by [Javier Fern√°ndez](https://twitter.com/JaviOnData) and [Luke Bornn](https://twitter.com/LukeBornn)) to [NFL tracking data](https://twitter.com/sonty_1/status/1269082435293270024).

But showing that it can be done is not the end station. These great research papers need to be applied within the clubs. A lot clubs! 

When we bring together the researcher, club AND the community magic will happen! Companies can accelerate this by funding a project with money or knowledge.

### Let's start a movement!
Did you build something super cool and want to share with the world? Please do! Consider searching for a project that does almost the same and create a pull request to integrate your goodies. Or create a new open-source project.

What makes it easier for people to use your project?
- Don't make people think. Hide complex layers from the end-users. 
- Provide Examples. Most people learn from examples. They will change them to apply to their use-cases
- Add extensive documentation. For most people it won't be the starting point, but in case of issues people will look into it.
- Make your APIs forgiving. When end-users provide wrong arguments raise helpful exceptions with a pointer to how to solve it.
- Add a license (once again: ["Listen to Thom Lawrence"](https://twitter.com/lemonwatcher/status/1252970956756332544)). Make it possible for others to actually use it.
- Make it [pip](https://pypi.org/project/twine/) / conda installable. Just install and go with the bananas.

What makes it easier for people to contribute?
- Have a CONTRIBUTING guide. Explain the workflow.
- Label issues with a "good first issue". This makes it easier for people to get familiar with the codebase. Example from [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
- Use [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) to setup everything you need like code formatting, linting, testing etc. [Guide on how-to setup project](https://sourcery.ai/blog/python-best-practices/)


Contribute! Contribute! Contribute!
What if you want to contribute but not sure how? There are some nice guides around and maybe the project itself has a guide on how to contribute.
[Kevin Markham](https://twitter.com/justmarkham) wrote a nice step-by-step guide about [contributing to a github hosted project](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/).
