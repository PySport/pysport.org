We are very excited to announce that Jan Van Haaren joins the kloppy project as a maintainer. 

## Multiple maintainers

Last month Bruno stepped back as one of the maintainers of kloppy. For a project like kloppy it's important to have multiple maintainers to make sure different perspectives are taken into account for the further development.

## Jan Van Haaren

We are pleased that Jan Van Haaren wants to help with kloppy in the role of maintainer. Jan brings a lot of experience in the field of open-source projects (e.g. socceraction), soccer knowledge and also how analytics processes work within a professional organisation.

He will guide the project together with Koen Vossen. In the short term, the focus will be on creating more tutorials showing how kloppy can be used in analytics pipelines, like expected goals model pipeline.
