We are very excited to announce that Bruno Dagnino joins the kloppy project as a maintainer. The metadata models are his first contribution. Read more about Bruno and why he joined.

## Bruno
I'm Bruno Dagnino, co-founder and CTO of Metrica Sports, and from now one, a mantainer of Kloppy :). Since this is my first big contribution to Kloppy and to an open-source project, I thought it would be a good time to introduce myself and answer two questions: Why open-source? Why Kloppy?

#### Why open-source?
1. While building Metrica Sports we used several open-source libraries and packages. Without them we wouldn't be able to create, build and innovate at the pace we do it. It truly is standing on the shoulders of giants. We (and I) have always wanted to contribute back.
2. Metrica's mission is to provide best-in-class performance analysis tools to organizations at all levels of the game, and contributing to open-source projects is a great way to do it.
3. As we are doing we with our Open Data Project, we want to help the community grow. The more it grows, the better for us, for the community, clubs, and the sport as a whole.

#### Why Kloppy?
1. Because it's desperately needed. Loading data, dealing with different providers formats, coordinates systems, extracting metadata, etc takes a huge amount of times. The faster clubs, analysts, hobbyist can get to do actual analysis and less data handling, the faster the community will grow.
2. Because of it's code quality. It's very common occurrence in the analytics community is to have loose scripts, some work on some data, some on others, sometimes requirements are not clear, they are not maintained, etc. This is not bad per se, it creates innovation, inspires and teaches others to do more. However it's also important to consolidate all that knowledge and tools into packages that have great code quality, are well maintained and can capitalize on the contributions of different members of the community.
3. Because of it's vision and projection. Several members of the community already started contributing to and using Kloppy on their projects (Metrica being one of them!). I believe Kloppy has great potential to be a widely used package by the community and the applications and analysis of the future. Kloppy will be a shoulder, for others to stand on.
